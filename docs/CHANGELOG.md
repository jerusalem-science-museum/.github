### 11.12.25
- changed logo of museum github org
- added initial logic for scraping all museum projects [here](https://github.com/jerusalem-science-museum/.github/blob/main/scripts/generate_index.py)
- created simple commit-and-push-all-repos located [here](https://github.com/jerusalem-science-museum/.github/tree/main/scripts) (you need both museum-sync files and only run the .bat file).
